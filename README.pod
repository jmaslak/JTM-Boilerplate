=head1 NAME

JTM::Boilerplate - Default Boilerplate for Joelle Maslak's Code

=head1 VERSION

version 2.190670

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use JTM::Boilerplate 'script';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module serves two purposes.  First, it sets some default imports,
and turns on the strictures I've come to rely upon.  Secondly, it depends
on a number of other modules to aid in setting up new environments (I can
just do a "cpan JTM-Boilerplate" to install everything I need).

This module optionally takes one of two parameters, 'script', 'class',
or 'role'. If 'script' is specified, the module assumes that you do not
need Moose or MooseX modules.

=head1 WARNINGS

This module makes significant changes in the calling package!

In addition, this module should be incorporated into any project by
copying it into the project's library tree. This protects the project from
outside dependencies that may be undesired.
